I was unfortunatly unable to finish this game because my private life got in the way. The idea was to create a 2d roguelike where you can take over robots that attack you by hacking them.

Controls:
- AWSD/arrow keys to move
- Space to fire a laser when hacking a robot (use AWSD or arrow keys to fire it in a different direction)

How to hack a robot:
Touch the robot's back.
